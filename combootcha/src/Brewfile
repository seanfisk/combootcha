#     RetroArch has now gained a Metal renderer! Targeting modern macOS at first. XMB/MaterialUI works, menu shader pipelines work, Slang shaders work thanks to SPIRV-Cross, fonts work, etc!
#
#     Previously, RetroArch for OSX/macOS only had an OpenGL video driver. Since Apple will be deprecating OpenGL support in the near future, this Metal video driver essentially future proofs RetroArch for mac!ï»¿
