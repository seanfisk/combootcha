# Unautomated setup

This file lists parts of macOS setup that are not automated. Typically, this is due to technical or practical reasons.

## Work

TODO move to work repo

* Zoom
  - Need to click *Add a calendar* to add Outlook so that meetings show up
  - I tried to install the [Zoom for Outlook](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005223126-Installing-the-Zoom-for-Outlook-add-in#macOS) add-in from [Microsoft's site](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/wa104381712), but it just says *Installation failed*.

* Firefox

  - Install Bitwarden add-on

* Privacy & Security approvals
  - Zoom needs to be given rights to access camera, microphone, and screen in Security & Privacy. App will prompt for this.
