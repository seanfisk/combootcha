# Tasks

## Must do

- Natural scrolling seems to not take effect
  - Check for touchpad clicking too
  - Anything that won't update needs to be set manually
- "Firefox.app is damaged" and iTerm2 needs permission to modify apps
- `with_shell` doesn't actually change the shell. We need to use `chsh`.
- Add aText or remove from setup (for now)
