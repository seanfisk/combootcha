# Things to add

When there are several options to try, they're ordered by preference from cursory research.

## Check out iTerm2's option "Use built-in Powerline glyphs"

## Create bin/ directory

## japi-cc

## Set default browser to Firefox

## macOS User Defaults

Maybe we can set these directly without using the `defaults` command?

Idea: Fork the process and setuid to the specific user, then set the defaults programmatically.
