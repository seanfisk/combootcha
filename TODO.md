# Tasks

## Must do

- When transferring to a new computer, note that `combootcha` needs to be right-click Opened before it can be run through terminal
- Move mas stuff to the end of `Brewfile` as it is best to have LastPass or Bitwarden before App Store installs
- Add aText or remove from setup (for now)
- SSH: `Host *` should be at the end of the file
