# Tasks

## Must do

- Natural scrolling seems to not take effect
  - Check for touchpad clicking too
  - Anything that won't update needs to be set manually
- "Firefox.app is damaged" and iTerm2 needs permission to modify apps
- `with_shell` doesn't actually change the shell. We need to use `chsh`.
- When transferring to a new computer, note that `combootcha` needs to be right-click Opened before it can be run through terminal
- Move mas stuff to the end of `Brewfile` as it is best to have LastPass or Bitwarden before App Store installs
- Add aText or remove from setup (for now)
- SSH: `Host *` should be at the end of the file
- Sign in to App Store (needed for Microsoft To Do, but also a thing we should just do)
- Set up iCloud
- Sign into Firefox sync
- Sign into Microsoft To Do
