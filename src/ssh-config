# We originally used to query for the system's temporary directory, but on macOS
# that can result in paths that are too long. That's because the max path length
# for a Unix socket is typically 104 on macOS and 108 on GNU/Linux. Just use
# /tmp here to get a very short name -- it should work on most platforms.
