# Only the *first* value of each directive is used. See `man ssh_config' for more info.
# Also, this file is indentation-insensitive and the `Host' directive causes all following directives to apply to it. Hence the `Host *' at the end.

# I've used connection sharing with ControlMaster for a loooong time now so I
# have a lot of experience with it. When it works, it works great. Connections
# are snappy. However, my big issue with it is that when macOS sleeps, the
# socket is left open but the connection dies. When macOS wakes, SSH tries to
# use the dead socket which results in this message:
#
#     muxclient: master hello exchange failed
#
# After seeing this, each connection will take forever to establish until the
# socket is manually removed and then re-established.
#
# A possible way to solve this problem would be to clean up all sockets on sleep
# or wake. However, this isn't built into OpenSSH so I'd have to implement it
# myself. Until this is implemented, I'm going to disable this feature and see
# how I like it.

# We originally used to query for the system's temporary directory, but on macOS
# that can result in paths that are too long. That's because the max path length
# for a Unix socket is typically 104 on macOS and 108 on GNU/Linux. Just use
# /tmp here to get a very short name -- it should work on most platforms.
